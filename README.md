## Diabetes Prediction System  

##  Overview  
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, and more.  
An interactive **Streamlit web application** has been built to allow users to input patient data and get real-time predictions with probability scores.

##  Features  
-  Multiple ML models trained (Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
-  Preprocessing with scaling and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
-  Best-performing model saved and integrated into the app  
-  Interactive **Streamlit UI** for real-time diabetes prediction  
-  Probability-based prediction output
